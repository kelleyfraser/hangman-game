# Hangman Game

This app was created as a final capstone project for the HyperionDev Web Development Bootcamp. It was created using Create React App.

## Getting Started

  ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/kelleyfraser/hangman-game.git
    cd hangman-game
  ```

## How to Play

- Guess one letter at a time to reveal the secret word.
- Each incorrect guess adds a portion to the hangman character. You only get 6 total incorrect guesses.
- You can restart a level at any time by clicking the refresh icon in the top right corner.
- If you lose a level you must try again until you get the word before you're able to move to the next level.
